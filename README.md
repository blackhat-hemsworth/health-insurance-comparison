# Visual Comparsion of Health Insurance Plans
## How Does Each Plan's Prospective Cost Vary Given the Spending of Two Enrollees?

This .qmd (r) project can be quickly edited to reflect different combinations of premium, deductible, co-insurance, and out of pocket maximum. Just edit the dataframe on line 20.

The intent of the visualizations is to 

1. Give a quick visual depiction of overall spending vs. how much each person incurs in healthcare costs -- in checking out the fun plan structures in this year's open enrollment, I realized that one person incurring $3k in deductible-related costs and two people incurring $1.5k each can have *very* different outcomes in terms of total spend.
2. Quickly understand the "break even" area for the *choice* between the two plans
3. Experiment to see whether 3d graphics can ever be helpful (jury is still out) 

Visualization only will work with two potential spenders -- it would be easy to add columns to account for more spenders using the provided function, but the visual would only be accessible to higher dimensional entities.
